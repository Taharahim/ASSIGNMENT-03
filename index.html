    <h1>Exploring the World of Literature </h1>
    <p>
        Classic novels have profoundly influenced literature by addressing timeless themes
        and offering deep insights into human nature and society. <br> <strong>Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice</strong> explores
        themes of <em> love, social class, and personal growth </em>, setting a precedent for the modern romance genre. 
        <br><strong>George Orwell's 1984</strong> delves into the <em>dangers of totalitarianism and the loss of individual freedom</em>, 
        serving as a powerful political allegory. <br><strong>Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird</strong>confronts themes of <em> racial
        injustice and moral courage</em>, inspiring readers to reflect on ethics and equality. 
        <br><strong>Herman Melville's Moby-Dick</strong>examines <em>obsession, revenge, and man's struggle against nature</em>, 
        solidifying its place as a literary masterpiece of philosophical depth. 
        <br><strong>Lastly, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby</strong>critiques the <em>illusion of the American Dream and 
        societal decadence</em> , capturing the spirit and disillusionment of the Jazz. <br> These novels continue to
        shape literary traditions and challenge readers to engage with complex social and personal issues</p>
